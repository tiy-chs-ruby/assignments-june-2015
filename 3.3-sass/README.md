* iteration
* and more!

## Details

### Deliverables
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-chs-ruby/assignments-june-2015) titled `3.3 - Sass -- YOUR NAME` with checkboxes as below under _Requirements_.
* A repository named `3.3-Sass` containing at least a `README.md` file
* A Pull Request (PR) in your `3.3-Sass` repo:
  * _from_ branch `dev`
  * _into_ branch master
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your PR

### Requirements
Using your homework assignment from yesterday, refactor your CSS to Sass and add more functionality if necessary. Your homework should include, but not be limited to utilizing

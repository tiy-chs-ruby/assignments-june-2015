# Data Modeling

## Description
As a developer, you will have to listen to non-technical people describe an application that they need built (and for which they will pay you!). The problem: since they are non-technical, they will not be able to architect the information required to make their requirements a reality.

This is where you come in.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should understand
* how to model data based on user requirements
* how to refactor a conceptual data model to provide for more abstraction

### Performance Objectives
* given a reasonable amount of time, you should be able to parse someone's thoughts for significant nouns & verbs & concepts

## Details

### Deliverables
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-chs-ruby/assignments-june-2015) titled `2.1 - Data Modeling -- YOUR NAME` with checkboxes as below under _Requirements_.
* A repository named `2.1-Data-Modeling` containing at least a `README.md` file
* A Pull Request (PR) in your `2.1-Data-Modeling` repo:
  * _from_ branch `dev`
  * _into_ branch master
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your PR

### Requirements
There must be a `README.md` file that contains models as headings with their properties listed as bullet points underneath based on the following text:

> I have an idea for an app.
>
> We are changing the way people manage their pictures! Someone should be able to sign in, upload a bunch of pictures and then be able to add information to each one like where it was taken, when it was taken and any additional notes. You know what? They should also be able to tag their family members. That sounds good.
>
> Each member of our amazing service should be able to see all of their pictures, and so should their family. There should be some sort of grouping that groups people together and allows them to see and comment on all of their group's photos.
>
> So how much will this cost me?

# React.js & Director

## Description
[Facebook's React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a great tool for learning about JavaScript component hierarchy, allowing you to create modular and maintainable code. [Flatiron's Director router](https://github.com/flatiron/director) makes dynamic URL routing, via `hashchange` or `pushState`, dead simple.

Your task is to refactor yesterday's assignment (7.3) to use Director and React.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should understand how to
* break down an interface in to components
* create React components
* created nested React components
* fetch and re-render a React component to display fetched data
* use a routing library in conjunction with React

## Details

### Deliverables
* [An issue in the class repo](https://github.com/tiy-chs-ruby/assignments-june-2015) titled `7.4 - react-director -- YOUR NAME` with checkboxes as below under _Requirements_.
* A repository named `7.4-react-director` containing at least a `README.md` file
* A Pull Request (PR) in your `7.4-react-director` repo:
  * _from_ branch `dev`
  * _into_ branch master
* A comment on your original Issue with a link to your PR

### Requirements

# Moosic

## Description
The first part of building any app is figuring out what sort of data architecture we're going to need to allow us to accomplish our goals. Your mission is to take the concept of a music management system and turn that in to a relational data model. Some examples include `Album`, `Song`, `Artist`, `Playlist` and `Genre`.

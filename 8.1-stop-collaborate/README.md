# STOP! Collaborate & Listen

## Description
The majority of this assignment is to start to get you used to collaborating with others.

The subject of the app will be an expenses/budgeting app. Your task is to create a Rails project that uses `browserify-rails` and `reactify` to render a React application on the page with JSX (though JSX+reactify are optional). This is not much homework, so here are the additional collaboration requirements:

1. create a GitHub organization
1. create a repository under this organization
1. you and your teammates should each fork this repository
1. each team member should have specific tasks associated with this assignment assigned to them, though the teams should all work in unison so that all parties understand all parts of the code.
1. pull requests should be created from your fork's feature branches (NOT MASTER!) to the upstream repository's `master` branch and then fetched and rebased (or pulled) down from the upstream repo to the fork.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should understand how to
* Collaborate on GitHub projects with others
* Be able to set up browserify with React in a Rails app
